# simple-dice-game
I changed the UI and added some new features, game is based on project from "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

### üìë GAME RULES:
‚û°Ô∏è The game has 2 players, playing in rounds<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his current score.<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è The player can choose to *Hold*, which means that his current score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è The player loses his current score when one of the dices is a 1. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game (the player can change the winning score in the input field).<br/>
